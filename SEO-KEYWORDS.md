## 🔵 PRIORITY 3: Content Gaps to Fill

### What Competitors Are Missing
Based on competitor analysis, these topics have thin coverage:
1. **AI agents for non-technical users** - Most content assumes coding knowledge
2. **Real cost breakdown of AI tools** - Honest pricing comparisons rare
3. **AI workflow case studies** - Specific before/after examples
4. **AI security for beginners** - Simple privacy guides
5. **Local AI vs cloud AI** - When to use each
