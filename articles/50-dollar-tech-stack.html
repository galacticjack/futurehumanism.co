    <article>
        <p>Everyone loves showing off their tech stack. Most of those lists cost $500+/month and include tools the person barely uses.</p>

        <p>Here's the opposite: every tool I actually use daily to run a profitable side business, for less than the cost of a gym membership.</p>

        <h2>The Core Stack</h2>

        <div class="tool-card">
            <h4>Claude Pro <span class="price">$20/mo</span></h4>
            <p>My AI workhorse. Writing, coding, research, analysis, brainstorming. If I could only keep one subscription, it's this one. The 200K context window means I can paste entire codebases or documents and get useful output.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-card">
            <h4>Cursor Pro <span class="price">$20/mo</span></h4>
            <p>VS Code + Claude Code, integrated perfectly. Tab autocomplete that actually works, AI chat that understands my codebase, and Composer mode for multi-file edits. Doubled my coding speed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-card">
            <h4>Vercel (Hobby) <span class="price">$0</span></h4>
            <p>Free hosting for all my projects. Automatic deploys from GitHub, preview URLs for every PR, and edge functions. The free tier is absurdly generous.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-card">
            <h4>GitHub (Free) <span class="price">$0</span></h4>
            <p>Code storage, version control, project management with Issues. Private repos are free now. No reason to pay unless you need advanced team features.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-card">
            <h4>Supabase (Free) <span class="price">$0</span></h4>
            <p>PostgreSQL database with auth and storage built in. The free tier includes 500MB database, 1GB storage, and 50K monthly active users. More than enough to validate any side project.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-card">
            <h4>Beehiiv (Free) <span class="price">$0</span></h4>
            <p>Newsletter platform with 2,500 subscribers free. Built-in growth tools, clean analytics, and the best free tier in the newsletter space. No brainer for building an audience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-card">
            <h4>Gumroad <span class="price">~$5/mo avg</span></h4>
            <p>Sell digital products with no monthly fee—just a 10% cut of sales. When you're making money, it takes a small piece. When you're not, it costs nothing. Perfect alignment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-card">
            <h4>Namecheap Domain <span class="price">~$1/mo</span></h4>
            <p>$12/year for a .com domain. That's a dollar a month. If you're not investing $12/year in a proper domain, you're not serious about your project.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="total-box">
            <h3>Total: ~$46/month</h3>
            <p>Everything you need to build, launch, and sell digital products</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What I Don't Pay For (And Why)</h2>

        <h3>Email Marketing ($30-100/mo saved)</h3>
        <p>Beehiiv's free tier beats paid ConvertKit for my needs. When I hit 2,500 subscribers, I'll happily pay—but that's a good problem to have.</p>

        <h3>Project Management ($10-25/mo saved)</h3>
        <p>GitHub Issues + a Notion database (free) handles everything. Don't need Asana or Monday for a solo operation.</p>

        <h3>Analytics ($0-50/mo saved)</h3>
        <p>Vercel Analytics (free), Plausible's free trial when needed, or just... checking revenue directly. Fancy dashboards don't make money.</p>

        <h3>Design Tools ($15-50/mo saved)</h3>
        <p>Figma free tier for mockups, Excalidraw for diagrams, and AI image generation when I need graphics. Canva free for social media.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>💡 <strong>The rule:</strong> Don't pay for tools until the free tier is actively limiting your growth. Most people pay for features they'll never use.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The "If I Had More Money" Upgrades</h2>

        <p>These are tools I'd add if my side business scaled to $5K+/month:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stripe Atlas ($500 one-time)</strong> — Proper LLC formation for serious revenue</li>
            <li><strong>Linear ($8/mo)</strong> — Better project management than GitHub Issues</li>
            <li><strong>Beehiiv Scale ($49/mo)</strong> — Advanced growth features and automations</li>
            <li><strong>Plausible ($9/mo)</strong> — Privacy-friendly analytics I actually check</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But notice: even the upgraded stack is under $100/month. The tools aren't the bottleneck—the work is.</p>

        <h2>What Actually Matters</h2>

        <p>I've tried expensive stacks. I've tried enterprise tools. Here's the truth:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Your tools don't make money. Your products do.</strong> A $500/month stack won't compensate for not shipping.</li>
            <li><strong>Free tiers are genuinely good now.</strong> The 2020s have been incredible for indie builders. Stop paying until you need to.</li>
            <li><strong>AI is the only tool worth splurging on.</strong> That $40/month for Claude + Cursor saves me 20+ hours of work. Everything else is incremental.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Start Here</h2>

        <p>If you're starting from zero:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Get Claude Pro ($20/mo) — this is your unfair advantage</li>
            <li>Set up GitHub + Vercel (free) — ship your first project this weekend</li>
            <li>Start a Beehiiv newsletter (free) — begin building audience immediately</li>
            <li>Buy one domain ($12/year) — make it real</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Total cost to start: $21 for the first month. That's less than two fancy coffees.</p>

        <p>The tools are not your excuse anymore.</p>
