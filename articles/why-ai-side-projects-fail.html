    <article>
        <p>I've built 12 AI-powered side projects in the last year. 8 made zero dollars. 3 made under $100. One makes consistent revenue.</p>

        <p>That's a 92% failure rate. And honestly? That's pretty good for this space.</p>

        <p>Here's what I learned from all those failures—and what finally worked.</p>

        <h2>The 5 Mistakes That Kill AI Side Projects</h2>

        <div class="mistake-box">
            <h4>❌ Mistake #1: Building an AI Wrapper Nobody Needs</h4>
            <p>"It's like ChatGPT but for [niche]!" Cool. Why would anyone pay for that when ChatGPT exists? Unless you're adding massive specific value, you're just a worse interface over someone else's API.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fix-box">
            <h4>✅ The Fix: Solve a Specific, Painful Problem</h4>
            <p>Don't build "AI for X." Build "the tool that saves X professionals 10 hours/week on [specific task]." The AI is the implementation detail, not the product.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-box">
            <h4>❌ Mistake #2: Spending Months Before Launching</h4>
            <p>The graveyard of side projects is filled with beautiful, feature-complete products that never found a single paying customer. You're not learning anything until real humans interact with your thing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fix-box">
            <h4>✅ The Fix: Ship in Days, Not Months</h4>
            <p>Your v1 should embarrass you slightly. If it doesn't, you waited too long. Get something live in a weekend, then improve based on feedback from actual users.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-box">
            <h4>❌ Mistake #3: No Distribution Strategy</h4>
            <p>"If I build it, they will come" has never been true, and it's especially not true in 2025 when everyone is launching AI products. The best product with no distribution loses to a mediocre product with great distribution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fix-box">
            <h4>✅ The Fix: Distribution First, Product Second</h4>
            <p>Before building, answer: "How will my first 100 users find this?" If you can't answer that specifically, you don't have a business—you have a hobby project.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-box">
            <h4>❌ Mistake #4: Racing to the Bottom on Price</h4>
            <p>Free tier. $5/month. "Cheaper than competitors!" You're not Costco. You can't win on price as an indie builder. You have no scale advantages and your API costs are the same as everyone else's.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fix-box">
            <h4>✅ The Fix: Charge More, Serve Fewer</h4>
            <p>Find 10 people who will pay $100/month instead of 100 people who will pay $10/month. Higher prices attract better customers, filter out tire-kickers, and give you room to actually deliver value.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-box">
            <h4>❌ Mistake #5: Building for Other Developers</h4>
            <p>Developers are the worst customers. They think they can build it themselves (and they're often right). They're price-sensitive. They'll hack around your paywalls. Non-technical people will actually pay for solutions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="fix-box">
            <h4>✅ The Fix: Target People with Money Problems, Not Tech Problems</h4>
            <p>Lawyers, real estate agents, agencies, consultants, e-commerce operators. People who bill $200+/hour and will happily pay $50/month for a tool that saves them an hour.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Playbook That Actually Works</h2>

        <p>After all those failures, here's the framework I now use for every project:</p>

        <h3>1. Start with a Painful Problem</h3>
        <p>Not "it would be nice if..." but "I am actively frustrated by..." Find these in Reddit complaints, Twitter rants, and conversations with people who aren't developers.</p>

        <h3>2. Validate Before Building</h3>
        <p>Can you get 5 people to say they'd pay for this solution? Can you find similar products making money? If competitors exist, that's good—it proves the market exists.</p>

        <h3>3. Build the Smallest Possible Thing</h3>
        <p>One feature. One use case. One type of customer. You can expand later. You can't un-waste the months you spent building features nobody uses.</p>

        <h3>4. Launch to Real Humans Immediately</h3>
        <p>Not Product Hunt (that's vanity). Find 10 people who have the problem and get them using it. Their feedback is worth more than 1,000 upvotes.</p>

        <h3>5. Iterate or Kill Fast</h3>
        <p>Give it 2 weeks of real effort. If you can't find anyone who cares by then, kill it and move on. The opportunity cost of nursing a dead project is massive.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>💡 <strong>The real secret:</strong> Most successful side projects aren't the first idea. They're the 5th or 10th. Speed of iteration beats quality of first attempt every time.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What My Successful Project Did Right</h2>

        <p>The one project that works? It's boring. It solves one specific problem for one specific type of customer. It charges $29/month and delivers enough value that they don't think twice about the price.</p>

        <p>It took me a weekend to build v1. Three months of iteration to make it good. And it only works because I found customers before I wrote code.</p>

        <p>That's it. No secret sauce. No viral growth hacks. Just relentless focus on solving a real problem for people who will pay.</p>

        <h2>Start Today</h2>

        <p>If you're thinking about building an AI side project:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Write down the specific problem you're solving</li>
            <li>Find 5 people who have this problem and would pay for a solution</li>
            <li>Build the ugliest possible version this weekend</li>
            <li>Get those 5 people to try it</li>
            <li>Listen to what they say and iterate</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Skip any of these steps and you're just gambling. Do all of them and you've dramatically increased your odds.</p>

        <p>Now go build something.</p>
