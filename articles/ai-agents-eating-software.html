        <p>Why every company needs an agent strategy in 2026, before their competitors do.</p>

<p><strong>Marc Andreessen famously said "software is eating the world."</strong> Thirteen years later, we're witnessing the next phase: <em>AI agents are eating software.</em></p>

<p>This isn't about chatbots getting better at answering support tickets. This is about autonomous digital workers replacing entire software categories, workflows, and business processes. And it's happening faster than most executives realize.</p>

<p style="color: #707070; font-size: 0.85rem; margin-top: 16px;">Read by developers, founders, and AI enthusiasts</p>

<p>Traditional software requires humans to drive every action. You open Salesforce, click through screens, enter data, run reports. The software is a tool - powerful, but passive.</p>

<p><strong>AI agents are fundamentally different.</strong> They don't wait for instructions. They observe, plan, act, and learn. They use tools the same way humans do, but they never sleep, never get overwhelmed, and never forget to follow up.</p>

<p>A CRM tells you about your leads. An AI agent <em>works</em> your leads - researching prospects, crafting personalized outreach, scheduling follow-ups, and updating records automatically. It's not software you use; it's software that works for you.</p>

<p>This isn't robotic process automation (RPA) with better marketing. RPA follows scripts. AI agents think.</p>

<p>When a customer emails with a complex billing question, an RPA system would either fail or route it to a human. An AI agent reads the email, understands the context, checks multiple systems, applies business logic, and crafts a personalized response - all while learning patterns to handle similar cases better next time.</p>

<p>While tech Twitter debates AI consciousness, forward-thinking companies are quietly replacing entire departments with agent-based workflows.</p>

<p><strong>Intercom's Resolution Bot</strong> now handles 70% of customer conversations without human intervention. But the really interesting part? Customer satisfaction scores <em>increased</em> when the bot took over routine queries, because human agents could focus on complex, high-value interactions.</p>

<p>The pattern repeats across industries: agents handle the predictable, humans tackle the exceptional.</p>

<p>Traditional sales teams spend 65% of their time on non-selling activities - data entry, research, follow-ups, pipeline management. <strong>AI sales agents are flipping this ratio.</strong></p>

<p>Companies using agent-assisted sales workflows report 3x more qualified conversations and 40% faster deal cycles. The agents don't replace salespeople; they make each salesperson as productive as a team of five.</p>

<p>Month-end close processes that historically took 10 days now run in 2 days with AI agents handling data reconciliation, variance analysis, and report generation. CFOs aren't just saving time - they're getting real-time insights that were previously impossible.</p>

<p>Deploying AI agents isn't plug-and-play. Companies that succeed navigate three core challenges:</p>

<p>Agents are only as good as the data they access. Many companies discover their CRM hygiene, process documentation, and integration quality are worse than they thought.</p>

<p><strong>Solution approach:</strong> Start with agents that can improve data quality as they work. Deploy them first in areas where messy data won't break critical processes, then expand as data improves.</p>

<p>Employees worry about job displacement. Managers worry about losing control. Executives worry about compliance and liability.</p>

<p><strong>Success pattern:</strong> Companies that frame agents as "digital assistants" rather than "replacements" see 4x higher adoption rates. The goal isn't fewer people - it's more capable people.</p>

<p>Most business processes span multiple systems. Agents need API access, authentication handling, error management, and fallback procedures across your entire tech stack.</p>

<p><strong>Practical approach:</strong> Start with single-system agents that prove value, then gradually expand scope. Don't try to automate everything on day one.</p>

<p>Every repetitive process in your business is a candidate for agent automation. <strong>The question isn't whether agents can handle it - it's whether your competitors will deploy agents first.</strong></p>

<p>Priority areas: customer onboarding, lead qualification, expense processing, inventory management, regulatory compliance, quality assurance.</p>

<p>Don't just bolt agents onto existing workflows. Redesign processes assuming unlimited digital workers with perfect memory and instant access to all company data.</p>

<p>Example: Instead of "agents help with invoicing," think "agents manage entire customer lifecycle from quote to payment."</p>

<p>You'll need systems to monitor agent performance, handle escalations, ensure compliance, and coordinate between multiple agents. This isn't optional - it's the foundation that determines whether your agent strategy succeeds or creates chaos.</p>

<p>Managing 50 AI agents is fundamentally different from managing 50 humans. Agents don't need motivation or career development, but they do need clear boundaries, escalation paths, and performance monitoring. The companies building this infrastructure now will have a massive advantage.</p>

<p>Deploy agents first in processes where mistakes are easily correctable and humans can quickly intervene. Build confidence and experience before tackling mission-critical workflows.</p>

<p>Learn fast, iterate quickly, expand gradually.</p>

<p>Here's what keeps me up at night: <strong>the companies that deploy effective AI agents first won't just improve their margins - they'll fundamentally change what's possible in their industry.</strong></p>

<p>When your competitor can qualify leads, onboard customers, and resolve support issues 10x faster than you, pricing isn't the differentiator anymore. Speed and responsiveness become the moat.</p>

<p>The window for first-mover advantage is measured in quarters, not years. Every month you spend "evaluating" AI agent strategies is a month your competitors gain operational leverage.</p>

<p>Successful agent deployment doesn't look like science fiction. It looks like:</p>

<p>The companies that get this right won't just optimize their existing business - they'll unlock new business models that weren't previously economically viable.</p>

<p>AI agents aren't coming. They're here. The question isn't whether they'll transform how business operates - it's whether you'll lead that transformation or get left behind by it.</p>

<p><strong>Start small. Start soon. Start learning.</strong></p>

<p>Because while you're planning, your competitors are shipping.</p>
