    <article>
        <p>Five years ago, wearables counted steps and tracked sleep poorly. Now they're detecting atrial fibrillation, predicting illness before symptoms appear, and providing insights that used to require lab work.</p>

        <p>But most people still just look at their step count. Here's what your devices can actually tell you, and how to use that data.</p>

        <h2>The Metrics That Actually Matter</h2>

        <p><strong>Heart Rate Variability (HRV).</strong> This is the gold standard for recovery and stress measurement. High HRV generally indicates good recovery and resilience. Low HRV suggests stress, poor sleep, or oncoming illness. Track trends over weeks, not daily fluctuations.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Your HRV baseline is personal. Compare to your own averages, not arbitrary "good" numbers. A drop of 20%+ from your baseline is more meaningful than the absolute number.
        </div>

        <p><strong>Resting Heart Rate (RHR).</strong> A rising RHR often signals overtraining, stress, or illness before you feel it. Athletes have caught COVID and other illnesses days early by noticing RHR elevation.</p>

        <p><strong>Sleep stages.</strong> Total sleep matters less than sleep quality. Deep sleep is when your body repairs. REM is when your brain consolidates memories. Aim for 15-20% deep, 20-25% REM. Most people are deficient in both.</p>

        <p><strong>Blood oxygen (SpO2).</strong> Useful for detecting sleep apnea (repeated drops during sleep) and respiratory issues. If you snore and see regular SpO2 dips, talk to a doctor.</p>

        <p><strong>Body temperature trends.</strong> Slight elevations can predict illness 1-2 days before symptoms. Also useful for women tracking fertility cycles.</p>

        <h2>The Wearables Worth Considering</h2>

        <p>Different devices excel at different things:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oura Ring:</strong> Best sleep tracking, excellent HRV, comfortable 24/7 wear. Limited workout features.</li>
            <li><strong>Whoop:</strong> Serious recovery and strain tracking. Great for athletes. Requires subscription.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple Watch:</strong> Best all-rounder. ECG, fall detection, emergency features. Good enough at everything.</li>
            <li><strong>Garmin:</strong> Best for endurance athletes. Outstanding GPS and training metrics. Less refined for general wellness.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs):</strong> Game-changer for understanding how food affects your body. No longer just for diabetics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>AI-Powered Insights</h2>

        <p>The real breakthrough isn't sensors. It's AI making sense of the data:</p>

        <p><strong>Pattern recognition.</strong> AI can spot correlations humans miss. "Your HRV drops 15% when you drink alcohol within 3 hours of sleep" or "Your deep sleep increases 20% when you exercise in the morning vs evening."</p>

        <p><strong>Predictive health.</strong> Algorithms that flag unusual patterns before they become problems. Early detection of atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea indicators, potential cardiac events.</p>

        <p><strong>Personalized recommendations.</strong> Not generic "sleep 8 hours" advice but specific suggestions based on your data. "Based on your recovery metrics, a rest day today would optimize tomorrow's performance."</p>

        <h2>Building a Health Stack</h2>

        <p>The most effective setup for most people:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>24/7 wearable:</strong> Oura or Apple Watch for continuous monitoring</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep optimization:</strong> Consistent tracking plus environment improvements (temperature, darkness, timing)</li>
            <li><strong>Optional CGM trial:</strong> 2-4 weeks to understand your glucose responses</li>
            <li><strong>Regular blood work:</strong> Annual panels to catch what wearables can't</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

        <p><strong>Obsessing over daily numbers.</strong> One bad night doesn't mean anything. Trends over weeks matter. Check weekly averages, not every morning.</p>

        <p><strong>Ignoring the obvious.</strong> No amount of data optimization beats consistent sleep, regular exercise, real food, and stress management. Data should refine these basics, not replace them.</p>

        <p><strong>Alert fatigue.</strong> Turn off most notifications. Weekly summaries are more useful than constant pings.</p>

        <p><strong>Privacy ignorance.</strong> Your health data is valuable. Know what you're sharing, with whom, and what they can do with it.</p>

        <h2>What's Coming</h2>

        <p>The next wave of health tech will include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-invasive glucose monitoring:</strong> No more finger pricks or patches</li>
            <li><strong>Hormone tracking:</strong> Cortisol, testosterone, estrogen from wearables</li>
            <li><strong>Mental health markers:</strong> Stress, anxiety, and mood tracking from biometrics</li>
            <li><strong>Integration with healthcare:</strong> Data that your doctor actually uses</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We're at the beginning of personal health monitoring. The people who learn to use this data now will have decades of baseline to compare against. Start tracking, but keep perspective. Data informs decisions. It doesn't replace living well.</p>
